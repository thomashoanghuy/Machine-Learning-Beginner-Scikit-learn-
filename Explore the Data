#First download the data under this link https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course  and save in your local folder 
# Define your file path and read your dataset by pandas

#Let's check if there is any missing data in our dataset.
melbourne_data.isna().sum().sum()

Result = 13256

#There are missing data (na) in our dataset, so it's better if we just drop these NA data for now.
melbourne_data = melbourne_data.dropna(axis= 0)

# Select our target variable (the variable which we want to predict)
# In this case, it is Price of the property

y = melbourne_data.Price

#Next let's see all the columns of these dataset that we are working with.
melbourne_data.columns

#Now I don't know much about housing prices, but to predict our target variable, we must select some columns from these columns.
#Let's just select the obvious predictors that will definitely affect housing prices.

melbourne_features = ['Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'Lattitude', 'Longtitude']
#we call all these predictors X
X = melbourne_data[melbourne_features]

#Great, now essentially machine learning model is mathematical functions that calculate y from x.
#for example, Linear Regression, the easiest to understand, y = m * X + c (m being the gradient of the graph, c is the constant)
